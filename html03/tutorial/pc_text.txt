About the Company
-----------------
<h2>Our Company</h2>
<img src="pc_photo6.png" alt="" />
<p>We are a company located in Essex, Vermont, dedicated to
making delicious chocolate and other treats. For our founder,
chocolatier Anne Ambrose, this means using only the finest
organic ingredients, incorporating a harmonious blend of rich
flavors and smooth textures.</p>
<p>Anne learned her trade as part of a three-year apprenticeship
program in Switzerland. Her introduction into the world of
confectioneries was a springboard to working with leaders in
the field. Early in 1993 she brought that expertise back to
Vermont and Pandaisia Chocolates was born.</p>

Enjoying Chocolate
------------------
<h3>Enjoying Chocolates</h3>
<p>We believe that the best chocolate is fresh chocolate.
Preservatives change the flavor and texture of chocolate.
For the best results, our chocolates should be consumed
within a few days of purchase. Store them in a
cool, dark place at a temperature of 60&deg; to
70&deg; such as a refrigerator or wine cellar.</p>

Healthy Chocolate
------------------
<h3>Healthy Chocolate</h3>
<p>Chocolate has a bad reputation because of the poor
quality of mass-produced bars loaded with lots of milk,
sugar, and butter &mdash; which are tasty but not
healthy. We start with organic ingredients, keep the
processed sugars to a minimum and produce dark chocolate
that is 73% cacao. At that level, you can reap the benefits
of a chocolate diet!</p>

Single-Origin and Blends
------------------------
<h3>Single-Origin and Blends</h3>
<p>We believe in single-origin chocolate made from one
variety of cacao harvested from a single region.
Single-origin chocolates take on the unique flavors of
their region (in the same way that wines adopt regional
distinctions.) Other chocolatiers use blends that combine
flavors from several regions. Let us know what you prefer.</p>

Ethical Produce
---------------
<h3>Ethical Produce</h3>
<p>We work directly with farmers in Peru, Ecuador, and Honduras,
where we learn first-hand about the economic struggles they
face. We pay above-market premiums to maintain our relationships
and support Fair Trade agreements. We're always striving to
foster a sustainable market for fine chocolate and to support
the hard-working men and women that produce it.</p>
