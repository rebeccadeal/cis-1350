      <h1>About the Mobile Kitchen</h1>
      <p>After many years of planing and saving, Mobile Panini hit the road,
      literally, with the purchase of a 2007 Chevy P90 that we rescued
      from its moribund existence as a dirty diaper van. After a
      thorough cleaning (trust us!) the van was retrofitted into a
      classic commercial kitchen with state-of-the art equipment.</p>
      <p>The 22' kitchen allows us to accommodate all demands, ranging
      from large corporate catering events to private dining parties.
      Just save us a parking space.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>A mobile restaurant is a great alternative for catering your
    wedding, event, or party. We do more than just deliver, we
    prepare your food from fresh ingredients and deliver it hot.
    Mobile Panini is ideal for those venues that lack an
    on-site food concession.</p>
    <p>Consider us for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Weddings</li>
      <li>Fund raisers</li>
      <li>Athletic Events</li>
      <li>Birthday Parties</li>
      <li>Sales Events</li>
      <li>... and much more!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Choose from our standard catering menu or call us to develop a
    customized menu for your special party or event. We're fast and
    we're flexible.</p>
