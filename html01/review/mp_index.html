		<p><strong>Mobile Panini</strong> is the culmination of the dream of Antonio and Carmen
		Dolcini, who came to America looking to serve people the
		authentic recipes learned from their Sicilian family.</p>
		<p>Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's deli where he
		learned the age-old secrets of Sicilian cooking. He refined his
		technique at the Culinary Institute of Milan. His younger brother,
		Carmen, with no less of a love for cooking and good food, also
		worked in the deli and became well-acquainted with the open-air
		fresh food markets of his home town. Carmen too, is a proud graduate of the 
		Culinary Institute of Milan.</p>
		<p>Now you can enjoy what they have learned and mastered, right outside
		your door; but with no compromises in freshness or delicacy of
		preparation. We've partnered with <em>Curbside Thai</em> to bring you the
		finest cuisine on four wheels - from the East and the West!</p>
