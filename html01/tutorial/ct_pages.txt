About Us
 
Curbside Thai brings the rich flavor of Thailand to 
North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35 
years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers 
that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte 
with our modern mobile food truck.

This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy 
paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various 
mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from 
11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and 
11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the 
difference! If you can't get away from your desk, 
Curbside Thai will deliver.

Contact us to cater your next party and experience 
what Carolina Traveler calls the finest Asian food 
on or off the streets of Charlotte.

Reviews

The culinary art of the food truck vendor has been steadily 
improving over the last 10 years with fine offerings from 
Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai. 
Sajja Adulet is to be congratulated for offering delicious 
and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. We think 
Curbside Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off 
the streets of Charlotte.

Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street fare 
and we all accept its limitations in exchange for the 
convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you 
don't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a 
master chef at several fine establishments on the East Coast, 
Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dining to the 
Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.
