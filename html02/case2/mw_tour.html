    <p>The Bike the Mountains Tour rises from the town of Littleton, Colorado
    and explores the Colorado Front Range. Our tour crosses the Continental
    Divide twice, giving you the opportunity to bike the highest paved roads in
    the United States. This tour is a classic showcase of Colorado's Rocky
    Mountain scenery.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Bike the Mountains Tour is <em>amazing</em>. I highly recommend it
      and would gladly return.</p>
      <p>&mdash; Steve H.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Not designed for the weekend cyclist, this tour is offered only for those
    fit enough to ride high mountain passes. We provide sag wagons and support.
    Your lodging and meals are also part of the registration fee. We guarantee
    tough climbs, amazing sights, sweaty jerseys, and lots of fun.</p>
    <p>This is the seventh year we've offered the Bike the Mountains Tour. It is
    our most popular tour and riders are returning again and again. Our
    experienced tour leaders will be there to guide, help, encourage, draft, and
    lead you every stroke of the way. Come join us!</p>

    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>We start from the foothills above Littleton, Colorado, promptly at 9am.
    The first day is a chance to get your legs in shape, test your gearing, and
    prepare for what's to come.</p>
    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <p>Day 2 starts with a climb up Bear Creek Canyon to Lookout Mountain,
