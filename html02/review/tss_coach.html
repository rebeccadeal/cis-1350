    <h1>Meet our Coaches</h1>
    <aside>
      <blockquote>
      I have been given great feedback and encouragement by the TSS coaches.
      This last winter I took part in the Winter Cycling class and it made a
      huge difference to my spring rides. The coaches are caring professionals
      and they know their business.
      </blockquote>
    </aside>
    <p>Our mission at TSS is to help you reach your athletic goals through
    motivation, support, and education. We have years of experience with
    athletes of all ages and abilities and we're happy to assist any athlete
    committed to pursuing his or her dreams.</p>
    <p>We offer one-on-one coaching, evaluation, and instruction; but we also
    offer small group practices. Our classes are never large in number. We
    believe that a low coach-to-athlete ratio provides the best results in the
    shortest time.</p>
    <p>Come in and introduce yourself to our team of coaches and educators.</p>

      <p>Alison brings an extensive background in physiology and biomechanics to
      TSS and 18 years of experience coaching in the health and fitness field.
      She is a USA Triathlon Level II Certified coach and is certified in
      strength, conditioning, and bike fitting. Before founding <em>Tri and
      Succeed Sports</em>, Alison built a private training studio for local
      athletes.</p>
      <p>Alison was a lettered volleyball player at the University of Texas and
      she picked up the sport of triathlon after graduation. Triathlons have
      been her passion ever since. She has competed in many short- to

      races in IM Texas, IM Brazil, and IM Chicago.</p>
      <p>Alison wants to provide personalized instruction to her athletes. She

        <h2>Kevin Hughes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>BS, USAT Level I</li>
          <li>Kinesiologist</li>
        </ul>
      </header>
      <img src="images/coach2.png" alt="" />
      <p>Kevin is a student of body mechanics. In addition to a Bachelor's
      degree in Kinesiology, Kevin brings certification in Swim Instruction and
      coaching. He has coached numerous recreational and elite athletes,
      including Sprint and Ironman triathletes.</p>
      <p>In addition to coaching individual athletes, Kevin has coached a
      variety of teams and groups. Kevin coached Swimming and Cross Country at
      Austin High School and Palmer Country Day School. As Head Coach, his swim
      teams set school records in 9 out of 11 events, won the Mid-Texas
      Conference Championship, and consistently finished in the top 3 at the
      Small School State meet. Kevin currently coaches the Masters swim classes
      at TSS.</p>
      <p>Since being talked into his first triathlon at 16, Kevin has always
      enjoyed the challenge the sport provides. His motivation comes from the
      desire to improve himself, not the desire to beat others.  Starting as a
      middle of the pack athlete, his initial goal was to work his way through
      the distances which culminated with an Ironman finish in 2010. Bill
      remains a student of the sport while helping others achieve their fitness
      and racing goals.</p>

        <h2>Tammy Whitmore</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>USAT Level I</li>
          <li>Certified Triathlon Trainer</li>
          <li>Certified Nutritionist</li>
        </ul>
      </header>
      <img src="images/coach3.png" alt="" />
      <p>Fitness has always been a part of Tammy's life. Whether it was running,
      cycling, or strength conditioning she has dedicated herself to fitness and
      a healthy lifestyle. Trained as a mechanical designer, Tammy has designed
      commercial strength products used in health clubs around the country. Her
      interests led her to TSS, first as one of our athletes and then, 4 years
      ago, as  a member of the staff.</p>
      <p>After completing her USAT certification training, Tammy designed the
      course of workouts we use with our runners and cyclists. Tammy is also our
      nutritionist; she believes that reaching one's fitness goals requires a
      holistic approach in which what goes into the body is as important as what
      comes out.</p>
      <p>Coming from an engineering background, Tammy looks at things from an
      analytical point of view.  Recently Tammy completed two seminars on
      cycling with power meters. Tammy believes in continuing education and has
      set her sights on receiving her USAT Level II certification and USAT youth
      coaching certification.</p>
