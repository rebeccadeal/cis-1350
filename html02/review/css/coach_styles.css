PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative
font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and
to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in
partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as
long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can
be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.

“Reserved Font Name” refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).

“Original Version” refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by
the Copyright Holder(s).

“Modified Version” refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting—in
