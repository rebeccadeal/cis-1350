    <h1>Conservation of Momentum</h1>
    <p>In an earlier <a href="#">lecture</a>, we learned from Newton's 3rd Law
    of Motion that <em>for every action, there is an equal and opposite
    reaction.</em> One consequence of this law is that if two objects collide
    the force applied from the first object to the second will be equal and
    opposite of the force applied from the second object to the first. The
    result is that the total momentum (<var>p</var>) of all of the objects in
    the system is the same before and after the collision. This principle is
    known as the <strong>Conservation of Momentum</strong>.</p>
    <p>In the animation below we have two objects approaching each other on a
    collision course. The 10kg red ball is moving at +1m/s and the 5kg blue ball
    is moving at &minus;1 m/s. The total momentum within the system is therefore:</p>
    <code>
      <var>p</var> = <var>m</var><sub>red</sub><var>v</var><sub>red</sub> +
      <var>m</var><sub>blue</sub><var>v</var><sub>blue</sub>
    </code>
    <code>
      <var>p</var> = (10kg)(1m/s) + (5kg)(&minus;1m/s) = 5 kg&#183;m/s
    </code>
    <p>If the red ball rebounds at a velocity of &minus;1 m/s, the blue ball
    must rebound with a velocity of +3 m/s to keep the total momentum of the
    system at 5 kg&#183;m/s, because:</p>
    <code>
      <var>p</var> = (10kg)(&minus;1m/s) + (5kg)(3m/s) = 5 kg&#183;m/s
    </code>

      <img src="images/ba_redball.png" id="redBall" class="ballImg" alt="" />
      <img src="images/ba_blueball.png" id="blueBall" class="ballImg" alt="" />
      <div id="redSpeed1" class="animText">+1 m/s</div>
      <div id="blueSpeed1" class="animText">&minus;1 m/s</div>
      <div id="redSpeed2" class="animText">&minus;1 m/s</div>
      <div id="blueSpeed2" class="animText">+3 m/s</div>
      <div id="momentum" class="animText">Total Momentum: 5kg &#183; m/s</div>
    </div>
    <p>The Conservation of Momentum assumes a closed system in which there are
    no other forces interacting with the two objects. If there is an external
    force, it will cause a change in momentum in the entire system. For example,
    the momentum will be changed by the force of friction, eventually leading to
    complete loss of velocity and momentum.</p>
