      <h1>My Mother, Kathleen Ferris</h1>
      <p>My mother was a remarkable woman. She was born in 1928 in Sterling,
      Nebraska. Her parents, Tom and Wyma Lewis, were farmers. From them she
      learned the virtues of hard work and perseverance. She met and married
      Paul Ferris in 1948, a druggist from Omaha. My mother was widowed in 1953
      when Paul was killed in an automobile accident. Alone, my mom supported
      the family and raised me, with the help of wonderful friends and family.</p>
      <p>She started as a cashier at the local Sears. Within a few months she
      was a shift manager and few years after that she had risen up the ranks to
      be a district manager. She broke more than a few glass ceilings in her
      climb up the corporate ladder. Yet she always had time for me and for her
      charity work. She knew what it was to be hungry and she knew that what we
      do for others is what will endure after we're gone.</p>
      <p>She was a sportswoman: an avid golfer and swimmer. We often would
      travel to Colorado to hike and camp in the mountains; but mother felt that
      continuing education was the key to happiness. She earned a Master's
      degree in Business when she was 43 and never stopped taking classes at the
      local college in subjects ranging from corporate law to ancient pottery.
      She nurtured my passion for writing and everything I write is ultimately a
      too-distant echo of her words.</p>
      <p>My mother passed away in 2008. I miss her.</p>
